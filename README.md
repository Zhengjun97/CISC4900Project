# Project4900

## Overview
This project is a web-based educational game designed to help students learn concepts such as the history of computer science and math skills through interactive quizzes and gameplay. The game is structured so that players can explore a world scene, interact with NPCs, and engage in boss battles where answering questions correctly allows them to attack the boss. This gamified learning approach makes education more engaging and enjoyable for students.

## Key Features
- **World Exploration**: Players can control their character, interact with NPCs, and explore different parts of the game world.
- **Answer & Attack**: Players can make attacks based on their answers to quiz questions during boss battles.
- **Boss Battles**: Players participate in turn-based boss battles, where correct answers lead to attacks on the boss, and incorrect answers result in the player being attacked.
- **Interactive Dialogue**: Players engage in conversations with NPCs before entering battle scenes, making the experience more immersive.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework**: Phaser JS
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Kenney assets, Visual Studio Code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project directory and launch the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Future Plans
- Improve the world scene with more interactive NPCs and environments.
- Implement transitions between world exploration and battle scenes.
- Add more complex boss battle mechanics and visual effects.
- Integrate advanced progress tracking and analytics to help players monitor their learning progress.
